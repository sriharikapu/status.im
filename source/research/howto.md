title: Getting Started with Swarm
---

## Intro
In this tutorial we'll learn how to use Ethereum's Swarm protocol to host a simple website on Swarm. While everything happens in your console for this tutorial, you should have your console ready. you will be able to unsderstand how to setup, upload and access different kinds of files, as well as the beginnings of what it is possible to build with Swarm. 

This tutorial is intended to provide you with the skills needed to adapt Swarm to your needs. You will be larning about how to set up Swarm and use it.  


We have created this specific document specially for this tutorial. Please feel free to add additional tutorials if you would like to help the community out.

Swarm offers a DDoS-resistant peer - to - peer storage and service solution with zero downtime, fault tolerance and censorship resistance as well as self-sustainability due to an integrated incentive system that uses peer-to-peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment.Swarm offers a local HTTP proxy if installed on a machine, Which is helpful in creating Dapp's. 

Swarm is a **persistent data structure**. Persistent data structures always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. Such data structures are effectively as their operations do not (visibly) update the structure in-place, but instead always yield a new updated structure. 

**HAMT - Hash Array Mapped Trie** is one of the best examples for persistent data structures, As they will preserve previous versions of itself on any updates. It is often used to implement a general purpose persistent map data structure. HAMT'S composped of Ideal Hash Trees which are mutable. 

Before we get started, let's make sure all our dependencies are properly set up, especially [install `geth`](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum)  and Swarm. We'll be using the latest version of Geth. 

#### Mac OSX
```
Install Homerew
 /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
 brew update 
 /* Just to upgrade */
 brew upgrade
 brew install go
 brew tap ethereum/ethereum 
 brew install ethereum
 brew install ethereum --devel 
 
```

After installing, run`geth account new`to create an account on your node. You can check other options `geth --help`. Alternatively you can build from the source code following the below mentioned instructions.

Clone the Github repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
brew install go
cd go-ethereum
make geth
```
You can now run`build/bin/geth`to start your node.


#### Linux
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common 
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum 
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ethereum
```

#### Windows
```
chdir <path to extracted binary> 
open geth.exe
```
After successful installtion of Geth, You need to [install Swarm](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

#### Install the 
```
go install ./cmd/geth
go install ./cmd/swarm
```
#### Getting Started with Swarm
One Swarm & Geth had successfully installed. A Geth account can be created using the following command

```
Geth account new
/* Set a password for your account */
Passpharse:
Repeat passphrase:
/* A new account will be created */
Address:{3acce0a2760799ad89883949f0332cb4e1052b7a}
```
Once your account is created you start swarm using the following command
```
swarm --bzzaccount 3acce0a2760799ad89883949f0332cb4e1052b7a
/* This will prompt for the passphrase, Pass your passphrase and your swarm will be started */
Passphrase: 
```
You can access the swarm on your browser at `http://localhost:8500`

#### Upload and Retrieve files on swarm
